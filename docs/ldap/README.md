# OpenLDAP Lightweight Directory Access <Badge text="In development" type="warning"/>

<TagLinks />

OpenLDAP is a free, open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol developed by the OpenLDAP Project. It is released under its own BSD-style license called the OpenLDAP Public License. LDAP is a platform-independent protocol.

[OpenLDAP website](https://www.openldap.org/) [GitHub](https://github.com/openldap/openldap)

Setup and configuration has been tested on the following operating systems:

* Ubuntu 20.04
* 

The OpenLDAP Software 2.4 Administrator's Guide can be read [here](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/).

Berkeley DB version 6.0.20 and later uses a software license that is incompatible with LDAP technology and should not be used with OpenLDAP.

### Symas OpenLDAP

Symas OpenLDAP comes as pre-compiled and fully tested libraries and installs using native OS installation tools. Itâ€™s streamlined for easy setup and administration, and supports secure authentication methods, encryption and replication. To give you greater deployment flexibility and to help you maintain "as is" legacy environments, Symas OpenLDAP offers a choice of high-performance transaction-oriented databases, including an "old-school" database based on Oracle Berkeley DB, as well as a high-performance memory-mapped database (Symas Lightning Memory-mapped Database), based on our new open source memory-mapped b-tree technology. Both of these databases allow hot backups and automatically recover after power failures or system crashes.
