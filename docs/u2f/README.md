Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) is an open standard that strengthens and simplifies two-factor authentication (2FA) using specialized Universal Serial Bus (USB) or near-field communication (NFC) devices based on similar security technology found in smart cards. While initially developed by Google and Yubico, with contribution from NXP Semiconductors, the standard is now hosted by the FIDO Alliance.

## Configuration files

## Prerequisites

## Security Key by Yubico <Badge text="affiliate links" type="warning"/>

In this tutorial we use the [Security Key by Yubico](https://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGR0dNRkJHRk1NR0ZCRk5GSkxK). The reason we use it, besides the reasonable pricing, is that its not only compatible with PrivacyIDEA (authentication server) but supports plenty services e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Cloudflare, AWS, CentOS, Ubuntu etc.
