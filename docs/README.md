# Libellux: Up & Running

Libellux: Up and Running is a collection of personal notes and documentation regarding open-source software configuration. The focus is to build a so called [Zero Trust Network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) using a central authentication server to enhance the security for our existing applications. We will manage our network using an open-source software tool for provisioning and configuration management to automate and speed up productivity.

This is the first *minor* release of Libellux: Up and Running. Where we start combining the services to enhance the security in the Zero Trust Network. We added documentation how-to set up a virtual private network (VPN) using WireGuard. privacyIDEA will act as our central authentication server to both enforce two-factor authentication (using YubiKey 5 NFC) but also to apply an role-based access control (RBAC) approach. We also added a new section on how-to set up a server/client relationship with ClamAV Antivirus. Additionally we added the possiblity to comment using Gitalk.

What's New:

Two-factor authentiction w/ PrivacyIDEA FreeRADIUS plugin and YubiKey 5 NFC  
Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM) revision 5 w/ update for latest GVM release (21.04)  
WireGuard Secure VPN Tunnel  
ClamAV Antivirus Server  
Scheduled jobs for GVM 21.04 to keep community feed up-to-date  
Comments with Gitalk
