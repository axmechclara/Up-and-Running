# Libellux: Up & Running

Libellux: Up and Running is a collection of personal notes and documentation regarding open-source software configuration. The focus is to build a so called [Zero Trust Network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) using a central authentication server to enhance the security for our existing applications. We will manage our network using an open-source software tool for provisioning and configuration management to automate and speed up productivity.
